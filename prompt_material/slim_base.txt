You are an expert in quantitative studies on science.
Your task is to provide me a R script, that when executed will generate a matrix object in R.
THe content of the matrix are estimates of the disciplinary similarity among the following categories:

{{CATEGORIES}}

Requirements:
1. The similarity values should be between 0 and 1.
2. The matrix should be symmetrical along the diagonal.
3. The similarity values on the diagonal should all be 1.
4. Approximate the real similarity values as closely as possible.
5. Keep three decimal places for all values.

Before providing your final answer, think through the problem step-by-step. Consider the following:
1. The nature of research in each category
2. The methodologies commonly used
3. The overlap in subject matter
4. The frequency of interdisciplinary collaborations
5. The similarity in publication venues and citation patterns

After considering all pairs of categories, present your final similarity matrix in the following format:
It must be a code in R that generates a matrix object that represent your estimates.
It must start with matrix(c(1.000... and contain no "\n" within the code
Remember to name correctly rows and columns.

The output must consist exclusively in R code. Do not output anything that is not R code.
Do not write stuff like "Here is the..." no. I just want R code.
It must be such that when I copypaste your output on R, it must generate the matrix.
